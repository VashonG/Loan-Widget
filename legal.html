          <h2>E-Sign Consent Agreement</h2>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Last updated: 8/7/2022</em></p>
          <p>This Electronic Communication Disclosure (“<strong>E-SIGN Consent</strong>”) applies to all communications and/or disclosures that we are legally required to provide to you in writing in connection with your Account and any related products and services (“<strong>Communications</strong>”). This E-SIGN Consent supplements and is to be construed in accordance with the terms contained in the applicable terms of service (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”) you received from KAPED INC..</p>
          <p>The words &quot;<strong>we</strong>,&quot; &quot;<strong>us</strong>,&quot; and &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot; refer to KAPED INC.. The words &quot;<strong>you</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>your</strong>&quot; mean the account holder. &quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot; means the account you have with us.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Consent for Electronic Signatures, Records and Disclosures</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Your consent to the electronic delivery of disclosures will be required before you can begin using your Account. If you are unable or unwilling to provide such consent, please do not enroll for an Account. Once you have activated your Account, you may withdraw your consent for E-SIGN and request paper communications and/or disclosures as noted below.</p>
          <p>We suggest you read this document and print a copy for your reference.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Scope of Communications to Be Provided in Electronic Form</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When you use a product or service to which this E-SIGN Consent applies, you agree that we may provide you with any Communications in electronic format, and that we may discontinue sending paper Communications to you, unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. Your consent to receive electronic communications and transactions includes, but is not limited to:</p>
          <p>●     All legal and regulatory disclosures and communications associated with your Account and any related products and services</p>
          <p>●     Your Agreement and any notices about a change in the Agreement</p>
          <p>●     Privacy policies and notices</p>
          <p>●     Error resolution policies and notices</p>
          <p>●     Responses to claims filed in connection with your Account</p>
          <p>●     Notices regarding insufficient funds or negative balances</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Method of Providing Communications to You in Electronic Form</li>
          </ol>
          <p>All Communications that we provide to you in electronic form will be provided by access to our website or by email.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>How to Update Your Records</li>
          </ol>
          <p>It is your responsibility to provide us with a true, accurate and complete email address, your contact information, and other information related to this E-SIGN Consent and your Account, and to maintain and update promptly any changes in this information. You may update your information by logging into your Account and updating your profile.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Hardware and Software Requirements</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To access, view, and retain electronic Communications that we make available to you, you must have the following software and hardware: A PC or Mac compatible computer or other device capable of accessing the Internet and an Internet Browser software program that supports at least 128 bit encryption. To read some documents, you may need a PDF file reader. If these requirements change while you have an active Account, and the change creates a material risk that you may not be able to receive Communications electronically, we will notify you of these changes. You will need a printer or a long-term storage device, such as your computer’s disk drive, to retain a copy of the E-Sign Consent for future reference.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Requesting Paper Copies</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We will not send you a paper copy of any Communication unless you request it or we otherwise deem it appropriate to do so. You can obtain a paper copy of an electronic Communication by printing it yourself or by requesting that we mail you a paper copy, provided that such request is made within a reasonable time after we first provided the electronic Communication to you. To request a paper copy, contact us by mailing your request to 571 W La Habra Blvd, La Habra, CA 90631.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right, but assume no obligation, to provide a paper (instead of electronic) copy of any Communication that you have authorized us to provide electronically. For the avoidance of doubt, requesting a paper copy of any Communication, in and of itself, will not be treated as withdrawal of consent to receive electronic Communications.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Communications in Writing</li>
          </ol>
          <p>All Communications in either electronic or paper format from us to you will be considered &quot;in writing.&quot; You should print or download for your records a copy of this E-Sign Consent and any other Communication that is important to you.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Federal Law</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that your consent to electronic Communications is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and that you and we both intend that the Act apply to the fullest extent possible to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Termination/Changes</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your electronic Communications, or to terminate or change the terms and conditions on which we provide electronic Communications. We will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.</p>
          <p><strong>10. How to Withdraw Consent</strong></p>
          <p>You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications in electronic form at any time by sending us a written request by mail to 571 W La Habra Blvd, La Habra, CA 90631. If you withdraw your consent, your Account and all associated cards will be closed in accordance with the Agreement and we will send subsequent required communications and disclosures to you in writing to the most current address we have on file.</p>
          <p>We will not impose any fee to process the withdrawal of your consent to receive electronic Communications. Any withdrawal of your consent to receive electronic Communications will be effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal. In the meantime, you will continue to receive Communications in electronic form. If you withdraw your consent, the legal validity and enforceability of prior Communications delivered in electronic form will not be affected.</p>

The only disputes excluded from this broadprohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small courtclaims, as provided below.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>13b. Dispute Resolution. Most disputescan be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us,you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at support@kaped.io or by CertifiedMail to 571 W La Habra Blvd, La Habra CA 90631. The disputeshould contain a brief written description of the dispute and your contactinformation (including your username if your dispute relates to a Platformaccount). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, theparties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question,or disagreement directly through consultation with KAPED, and goodfaith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit orarbitration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>13c. Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period ofsixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated underthe Dispute Resolution provision Section 13b, then either party may initiatebinding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided inthe “Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims CourtClaims” subsection below) subject to the terms set forth in provision Section13f. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms(including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’relationship with each other, and/or your use of KAPED shall be finally settled by binding arbitration. Regardless of themanner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue areasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings andconclusions on which the award is based.</p>
          <p>13d. Class Action Waiver. The partiesfurther agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respectiveindividual capacities only and not as a class action or other representativeaction, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action orseek relief on a class basis. YOU AND KAPED AGREES THATEACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUALCAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ORREPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the classaction waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for anyreason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then thearbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in theirentirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitratedisputes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>13e. Litigation of IntellectualProperty and Small Claims Court Claims.

Eitherparty may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claimswithin the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>13f. Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

Treasury released the final rules on April 30,2003 with compliance being mandatory as of October 1, 2003.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Customer Identification Program (CIP) and procedures in place to ensure all customersare properly and consistently identified. All document verifications ofcustomer identity are to be conducted prior to opening the account. Non-documentary means of verifying identity will be completed within onebusiness day of account opening. Customer will not have access to funds untilverification is complete. The platform will not open accounts where it is notfamiliar with the documents presented or cannot verify the customer&#x27;s identityusing the documentary and non-documentary methods described in this program. Ifan account was opened, and non-documentary verification efforts fail within areasonable period of time, the account will be closed, and collected fundsdisbursed to the prospective customer providing the platform has received noinstructions otherwise. Accounts closed for lack of non-documentaryverification will be reviewed by the Compliance Officer and/or designatedpersons. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>
          <p>At a minimum, financial institutions are required to:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1.      verify the identity of any person seeking to open an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable;</p>
          <p>2.      maintain records of the information used to verify the person’s identity, including name, address, and other identifying information; and,</p>
          <p>3.      Determine whether the person appears on any lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any government agency.   </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The U.S. Patriot Act requires that financial institutions implement a written Customer Identification Program (CIP) appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a minimum, contains each of the requirements of the regulation. These requirements, discussed in detail below, address the following:</p>

          <p><strong>Personal Accounts for Non-U.S. persons</strong></p>
          <p>It is difficult to identify and even more so to verify the identity of non – U.S. Persons. However, we must make due diligence efforts to do so. CIP requirements indicate you must obtain and record an identifying number prior to opening an account. This can be a passport number, ITIN (definition below), alien identification card number or number, and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>§  Non-U.S.  Citizens may be issued an ITIN number. ITIN numbers look like SSNs. However, they are issued by the IRS for tax reporting purposes, not the Social Security Administration. Valid ITIN numbers begin withthe number 9, and the 4<sup>th</sup> digit is a 7 or 8. </p>
          <p>§  These are legal for tax reporting and should be obtained if the non-U.S. person has been issued one.  </p>

          <p><strong>Monitoring of High-Risk Accounts</strong></p>
          <p>As part of this platform’s account opening process, the Compliance Officer is expected to administer procedures designed to identify high-risk accounts or customers representing a greater risk of being involved in money laundering, structuring, or other illegal activities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While not all-inclusive, the following are examples of high-risk accounts:</p>
          <p>§  Professional service providers such as lawyers, accountants, or brokers make substantialcash deposits into client accounts.</p>
          <p>§  Out-of-trade-area accounts</p>
          <p>§  Accounts opened through mail or by website</p>
          <p>§  Check cashing companies</p>
          <p>§  Convenience stores</p>
          <p>§  Wire Remitters</p>
          <p>§  Currency Exchanges </p>
          <p>§  Import/export companies</p>
          <p>§  Offshore corporations</p>
          <p>§  Non-resident aliens</p>
          <p>§  Foreign customers</p>
          <p>§  Foreign correspondent accounts</p>
          <p>§  Payable through collection, pouch, and special-use accounts</p>
          <p>§  Private banking</p>
          <p>§  Trust accounts</p>
          <p>§  Electronic accounts</p>
          <p>§  Accounts utilizing significant movement of funds through wire transfers</p>
          <p>§  PEP /Politically exposed persons</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>Enhanced Due Diligence</strong></p>
          <p>Utilizing a combination of system reports (i.e., currency transaction reports, balance fluctuation reports, suspect kiting reports, etc.) and visual observations,management personnel can identify whether an account, which is listed in thehigh-risk category, is suspicious. However, not all accounts identified are considered high-risk. Management personnel must make a determination and reportwhat transactions or activity prompted the account/transaction to be suspicious, thus monitoring the account for high-risk. Management personnelmust complete the <strong>BSA CHECKLIST FOR HIGH-RISK ACCOUNTS</strong> and set forth the frequency of periodic monitoring needed when an account is identified as a high-risk entity. A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is to be completed if the account/transactions are suspicious. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When an account or customer is deemed high risk due to activity inconsistent withnormal activity and the account is coded high risk, the activity in the account will be reviewed periodically or when suspicious activity is reported orappears on internal reports. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>High-risk geography monitoring, in addition to high-risk account monitoring by management personnel, is to be performed on an ongoing basis by the Compliance Officer utilizing a combination of internal and system reports (i.e., wire transfer reports, reports or forms indicating location or addresses for high-risk geography) and visual observations. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Compliance Officer&#x27;s responsibility is to validate the frequency of account monitoring by reviewing the file created by branch management personnel and subsequentlyrevising the frequency from time to time. In addition, the Compliance Officeris to determine whether an account should be closed, additional monitoring isrequired, or a SAR completed. Ongoing monitoring may be necessary and should bedocumented on the <strong>BSA CHECKLIST FORHIGH-RISK ACCOUNTS</strong>. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>Removing Customers from High-Risk List</strong></p>
          <p>To remove a customer from the High-Risk List, the Compliance Officer will access the customer&#x27;s risk profile and make a determination. After assessing the customer risk profile determines they should be degraded to a low or medium risk category, the change will be updated in the customer profile. The original criteria for adding the customer to the list, along with documentation of the reason for adding and removing the customer to or from the High-Risk list, are kept onfile internally for 5 years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Requests from personnel outside of the compliance department can be submitted to theCompliance Officer for consideration of removal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reasons for removal:</p>
          <p>1.      If the activity stops for a period of 6 months, the customer will be moved to mediumrisk.</p>
          <p>2.      After another 3 months with no suspicious or out of the ordinary activity, thecustomer will be moved to low risk.</p>
          <p>3.      After another 3 months for a total of 12 months with no suspicious or out of theordinary activity, the customer will be removed from this manual list.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Transaction Monitoring Software assigns risk ratings to customers and accounts according toparameters set up within the software. The software looks at activity inaccounts assigning percentages according to this activity. A risk score of 2.34or above is rated as a high-risk customer or account. Reports with risk ratingscan be run from the software.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>Notice to Customers</strong></p>
          <p>The institution shall provide notice and applicable disclosures to customers thatit is requesting information from them to verify their identities, as required by Federal Law.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)</strong></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If any platform personnel becomes aware of or suspects criminal activity or violations of theBSA by customers or employees, they should report the activity to the Compliance Officer for further review.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The platform shall have procedures in place to monitor and detect all known or suspectedcriminal offenses, transactions that involve suspected money laundering, or transactions that violate the Bank Secrecy Act. These procedures will includeat a minimum:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1.      maintain alist of “elevated risk” customers and have procedures in place to monitor account activity;</p>
          <p>2.      a review of repetitive cash transactions below the $10,000 reporting threshold;</p>
          <p>3.      a review of abnormal account activity to determine if it is suspicious or inconsistent withthe customer’s normal business;</p>
          <p>4.      a review of funds transfer activity;</p>
          <p>5.      monitoring of accounts of non-US persons;</p>
          <p>6.      a review of excessive ATM activity;</p>
          <p>7.      insider abuse;</p>
          <p>8.      check kiting; and</p>
          <p>9.      a periodic review of monetary logs.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Monitoring systems may be adjusted from time to time but must include the previously mentioned items to detect thefollowing money laundering strategies: </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>§  <strong>Placement</strong>, which is the placing of unlawful cash proceeds into the bank by deposits, wire transfers, or other means. </p>
          <p>§  <strong>Layering</strong>, which is the separating of the proceeds of illegal activities from their origins through the use of layers of financial transactions, such as converting cash into traveler’s checks, money orders, etc.</p>
          <p>§  <strong>Integration</strong>, which is combining illegal funds with legally obtained funds, and providing a legitimate explanation for its ownership.</p>
          <p>§  <strong>Structuring</strong>, which is dividing large cash transactions into several smaller transactions to evade detection from BSA reporting and/or record-keeping thresholds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wherecircumstances require the institution to report suspicious activity to itsprimary federal regulatory agency and federal law enforcement officials, suchsteps will be taken expeditiously. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ComplianceOfficer or Compliance Specialist will log the report, assign an anonymous filenumber, and conduct a preliminary investigation by gathering and documentinginformation. If there is evidence that indicates a violation or illegalactivity has occurred, the Compliance Officer or Compliance Specialist willaccumulate as much information as possible from the Platform’s records anddevelop a summary of the information found. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>TheCompliance Officer will consider the reported activity and supporting evidence.If the conclusion is made that a BSA violation or crime has occurred, a SARwill be filed. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Specialissues are raised when the platform receives a subpoena or court order seekingSAR records in connection with an action not related to the activity reportedon the SAR. In such cases, the platform should, in conjunction with legalcounsel, contact its primary federal regulator and FinCEN to obtain guidanceand direction on how to proceed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wherecircumstances allow, the platform will report suspected illegal customer oremployee activity to law enforcement authorities. It is our policy to carefullyevaluate all known facts prior to filing a report. The instructions to the SARprovide procedures to be followed in reporting suspicious activity. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Voluntaryreports will be filed when there is a reasonable basis for believing thatspecific criminal activity has occurred, is occurring, or may occur. Voluntaryreports will be filed with <em>federal,state, and local</em> law enforcement agencies as appropriate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All SARreporting will be reported to the senior management team at its next regularlyscheduled meeting. The report will include:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>§  type ofviolation</p>
          <p>§  date orrange of dates</p>
          <p>§  branch wherethe violation occurred</p>
          <p>§  dollaramount of violation</p>
          <p>§  loss to the platform(if any)</p>
          <p>§  if violationincluded a platform employee</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>SARs will befiled within 30 calendar days of the initial detection of the criminal orsuspicious activity. A delay of an additional 30 days is permissible, ifnecessary, to identify a suspect. The 30-day (or 60-day) period will begin whena review of the activity and a determination that the activity under review hasbeen determined to be &quot;suspicious&quot; with the meaning of the SARregulations. The review will be initiated promptly and completed in a reasonableperiod of time, considering the type of activity that is unusual and warrantsinvestigation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After aninvestigation, if the Compliance Officer and/or the Compliance Specialist findsthere is not sufficient cause for filing a SAR, the reason will be documentedon the Suspicious Activity Investigation Report and signed by the ComplianceOfficer.   The documentation file will be kept for 18months or until the next on-site examination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ifsuspicious activity continues by a customer, a SAR will be filed approximatelyevery 90 days. It is the policy of “<strong>platform” </strong>to risk rate any accountreported for suspicious activity as High Risk. The account may be left open ifapproved by the Compliance Officer and/or the CEO. If it is indicated that anongoing investigation is being conducted by law enforcement, the account may beleft open. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the platformsuspects an individual, entity, or organization of terrorist or moneylaundering activity and a SAR is filed, the platform may, under the protectionof the safe harbor for liability, share information with other financialinstitutions providing both institutions have filed the required certification noticewith FinCEN (Section 314(b)). </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>RecordRetention</strong></p>
          <p>§  All SARfilings will be kept for 5 years</p>
          <p>§ Investigation materials when a SARis not filed will be kept for 18 months</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em> </em>Although a SARpolicy is in place with <strong>KAPED</strong>, all unusual activityreporting will be reviewed and escalated to our banking partner (“<em>EvolveBank and Trust</em>”) foranalysis and final assessment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>CurrencyTransaction Reporting (CTR) requirements</strong></p>
          <p>Theregulation and platform procedure requires a CTR to be filed for each deposit,withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through, orto the Platform, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.A CTR is completed when the currency threshold is reached in single or multipleamounts conducted either by or on behalf of the same person on the samebusiness day. The instructions to Form 104 are to be followed by the Personnelhandling the transaction and preparing the CTR. The branch representative willtype or print his/her name as the preparer on the CTR and send it to the ComplianceOfficer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ComplianceOfficer or a Compliance Specialist reviews the daily report of large cashtransactions. This automated report is generated from our core system. Thereport reflects large cash transactions sorted by tax identification number andteller batches of cashed checks. The Compliance Officer or ComplianceSpecialist compares this report with CTRs created in the software programAnti-Money Laundering. The electronic filing system creates CTRs for single orin aggregate cash transactions over $10,000 (except where the transaction isfor an exempt person). Manual CTR&#x27;s may be added in the software program fortransactions such as negotiable instruments cashed that are not drawn on productsissued by “<strong>platform</strong>”. A CTRbatch is then filed electronically from the batches created in Anti-MoneyLaundering Software through the BSA Direct E-filing System from FinCEN. Batchesare sent weekly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the caseof multiple transactions, if one component of the transaction is greater than$10,000, the transactor information is required to be completed on the CTR. Amaster list with transactor information will be created at the office level andmaintained there if needed for reporting purposes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the platformrepresentative determines that multiple transactions which total more than$10,000 have taken place in any one business day, a CTR is to be completed. Forexample, if a platform representative can determine that &quot;John Doe&quot;deposits $5,000 in currency to his checking account at 9:00 a.m. and deposits$7,000 cash to his savings account at 2:00 p.m., a CTR should be completed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The platform’sinternal system will alert office personnel to complete a CTR when singletransactions are greater than $10,000. The office representative shall gatherany additional information needed to complete the CTR. The CTR will then beforwarded to the Compliance Officer to be completed in the electronic system.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The platformrequires the customer to provide proof of their identity, such as a validdriver&#x27;s license or state I.D. If an elderly or disabled customer does not havea driver&#x27;s license, other forms of identification such as a state I.D.,Medicare/Medicaid card, voter registration card, utility, or real estate taxbill may be used. In these cases, platform personnel will mark the identityline on the CTR as &quot;elderly&quot; or &quot;disabled&quot; and record themethod of identification as &quot;organization or membership card&quot; onlyI.D. Terms such as &quot;known customer&quot; or &quot;signature card&quot; arenot acceptable to complete a CTR.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daily, platformpersonnel forward all completed CTR’s to the Compliance Officer. There, theCTR&#x27;s are entered into the electronic filing system. The platform representativehandling a currency transaction greater than $10,000 will get accurate andcomplete information for completing the CTR at the time of the transaction. TheCompliance Officer or Compliance Specialist shall electronically batch file allCTR’s in a timely fashion, within 25 calendar days after the transaction date.The Compliance Officer has the overall responsibility to determine that allsteps are followed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the ComplianceOfficer is for any reason unable to perform the duty of completing and filing,CTR&#x27;s the Compliance Specialist will complete and file the CTR&#x27;s. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In theevent, the electronic system cannot be used, CTR&#x27;s may also be completed aspaper documents and filed (paper documents must be filed within 15 calendardays after the reportable transaction) by mailing them to IRS Detroit ComputingOffice, Attention: CTR, P.O. Box 33604, Detroit, MI 48232-5604. A copy of theCTR form 104 may be downloaded from the FinCEN Webb site www.fincen.gov/.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A copy ofeach Form 104 will be retained on paper or other media for a period of five (5)years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Exempting aBusiness from CTR Reporting</p>
          <p>The ComplianceOfficer is responsible for determining whether an account holder qualifies asan exempt person and for filing FinCEN Form 110, Designation of Exempt Person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The filingof these forms will be done using the BSA E-filing System.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the eventthe electronic system cannot be used, the forms may also be completed as paperdocuments and filed by mailing them to: IRS Detroit Computing Office,Attention: Designation of Exempt Persons, PO Box 33112, Detroit, MI 48232-0112.The Form 110 is available fordownload at the FinCEN Webb site at www.fincen.gov,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the ComplianceOfficer is unable to perform a review for a business or the annual review ofexempt persons, the Compliance Specialist will assume the responsibility of newbusiness filings, perform the annual review of all exempt persons, and monitoraccounts for suspicious activity. </p>

          <p>When the platformis a beneficiary company in a funds transfer, we will retain either theoriginal or a duplicate of the payment order. If the beneficiary does not havean account with the platform, our CIP procedure will help us verify thebeneficiary&#x27;s identity. If we have knowledge that the person receiving theproceeds is not the beneficiary, we obtain a record of the beneficiary&#x27;s nameand address, as well as the beneficiary TIN, if known by the person receivingthe proceeds, or a notation in the record of a lack thereof. If proceeds aredelivered other than in person, we retain a copy of the check or otherinstrument used to make a payment or the information contained therein as wellas the name and address of the person to which it was sent.</p>

          <p>The UnitedStates Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)administers laws that impose economic sanctions against hostile foreigncountries, entities, and individuals. It is the platform’s policy to complywith U.S. laws, regulations, and orders that restrict dealings by U.S. personsor entities with certain foreign countries, their nationals, or &quot;speciallydesignated nations (SDNs).&quot;  The platformwill not knowingly do business with, maintain accounts for, nor handletransactions or monetary transfers for foreign countries or foreign nationalslisted on OFAC&#x27;s Alphabetical Master List of Specially Designated Nationals andBlocked Entities (SDN List).</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><strong>OFAC Check</strong></p>
          <p>On a weeklybasis and after any update to the OFAC list, the Transaction Monitoring programperforms a comparative review between the list of prohibited countries,entities, and individuals as provided by the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign AssetControl (OFAC) and the platform’s account, customer and transaction database.This process ensures that no prohibited accounts are maintained or transactionsperformed with entities on the OFAC or any government lists.  </p>

          <p>AcceptedRisk</p>
          <p>All namesare checked when the Transaction Monitoring Software is run against the platform’sdatabase. OFAC searches against parties other than account holders,beneficiaries of wire transfers, or Checks (i.e., powers of attorney&#x27;s, guarantors on loans) will not beincluded in the periodic OFAC check, as they may not be listed on theportfolio. <strong>Theplatform </strong>is willingto accept this risk.</p>

          <p><strong>FinCEN Information Request  - Section 314(a)</strong></p>
          <p>Section 314 (a) of the USA PatriotAct requires the platform to search its records for suspected money laundersand terrorists “subjects of interests” which law enforcement has requestedinformation about and presented to FinCEN. FinCEN sends a list of namesrepresenting potential subjects of terrorism investigations or money launderinginvestigations. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Compliance Officer or Seniormanagement officer is designated to receive notification of all 314(a)requests. The e-mail request will be forwarded to the Compliance Officer andCompliance Specialist. They will be responsible for checking the 314a listagainst the platform’s database by downloading the People List and BusinessList to the Transaction Monitoring Software. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After the requests are run, the ComplianceOfficer or Compliance Specialist will look at each potential list matchingalert in Anti-Money Laundering and investigate the alert or assign the alert toanother person in the Compliance Department for investigation. After assuringthat the potential matches are false positives, they are noted as falsepositives within the Transaction Monitoring Software and deleted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A copy of the Audit Requirementreport showing the number of records checked and a printed copy of the FinCENpage of the “<strong>platform</strong>&quot;Subject Menu for the date will be kept as proof of checking the lists againstthe customer and account database.

The platform is not required to take anyother action and will not maintain the list for the purpose of evaluatingwhether to open an account or conduct a transaction unless specificinstructions accompany the request and state otherwise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A match does not automaticallyrequire the filing of a SAR, and the platform’s decision to file a SAR will bebased on the circumstance of the transaction or account activity only.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The search and response to anymatches will be completed within 14 days after receiving the request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the search does not uncover amatching account or transaction, then we will not reply to a 314(a) request.Furthermore, we will not disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested orobtained information from us, except to the extent necessary to comply with theinformation request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The institution will direct anyquestions we have about the request to the requesting Federal Law enforcementagency as designated in the 314(a) request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All information relating to searchresults will be retained for 5 years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The institution will not use theinformation provided by FinCEN for any purpose other than to assist the firm incomplying with any requirement of Section 314 of the PATRIOT Act.</p>

          <h1><strong>1.                  </strong>Summary / Overview</h1>
          <p>KAPED INC.  (“KAPED” and the Company) will from time to time engage in servicing and collections activity with respect to: (i) debts that are due and owing to KAPED; and (ii) debts that are due and owing to third parties. The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted this Servicing and Collections Policy (“Policy”) as part of its Compliance Management System. The Compliance Officer serves as the individual responsible for all activities related to lending, and oversees the development and implementation of this Policy.</p>
          <p>The Company intends to comply with applicable federal and state laws concerning loan servicing and the collection of commercial debt.  The purpose of this Servicing and Collections Policy and Procedures (“Policy”) is to describe the Company’s commitment to compliance with applicable state and federal collections and servicing laws. The Company takes its responsibility to comply with applicable servicing and collections laws seriously, and endeavors to mitigate losses with minimum delay and conflict and to treat each borrower with respect. </p>
          <h1><strong>2.                  </strong>Scope</h1>
          <p>This Policy applies to all activities and practices related to the servicing and collection of loans.</p>
          <p>This Policy applies to (i) Company employees; (ii) Company’s executives and senior managers (collectively, “Senior Management”); and (iii) any vendors providing services to the Company. </p>
          <h1><strong>3.                  </strong>Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
          <h2><strong>3.1              Board of Directors</strong></h2>
          <p>The Board of Directors oversees and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Company adheres to all applicable servicing and collections laws, regulations, and policies. The Board (or a designated Committee of the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving this Policy at least annually and any changes or modifications to the Policy as they occur. The Board also maintains oversight of compliance with Policy and any significant servicing or collection risks that Senior Management identifies.</p>
          <h2><strong>3.2              Compliance Officer</strong></h2>
          <p>Michael De Guzma is responsible for monitoring servicing activities of staff to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements, overseeing and maintaining evidence of servicing training (including training for laws related to service member protections, marketing, and fair lending), ongoing monitoring and testing to ensure adequate controls are in place to mitigate applicable servicing risks, and conducting regular assessments of Company’s servicing program. </p>
          <p>Additionally, the Compliance Officer is responsible for evaluating and updating the Policy to reflect any changes to (i) relevant products or services of Company, (ii) Employees, or (iii) applicable laws and regulations. The Compliance Officer reviews the Policy on a periodic basis and when any such changes are made.  Review includes consideration of feedback on the effectiveness of the Policy and any input from relevant Bank Partners.</p>
          <h2><strong>3.3              </strong>Servicing Team</h2>
          <p>The servicing team is responsible for knowing and understanding the organization’s risks, controls, and mitigation efforts related to servicing matters; reviewing regular reporting on escalated issues related to servicing and collections; ensuring implementation and support of this Policy by providing sufficient staff and resources to manage the risks; reporting to the Board on issues as needed, and assisting the Board with overseeing compliance with this Policy and any significant servicing and collections risks that management identifies.</p>
          <h2><strong>3.4              </strong>Legal</h2>
          <p>The legal team is responsible for reviewing and approving new scripts and playbooks for servicing and collections efforts; providing guidance to the Company about applicable servicing laws and regulations; and assisting with the resolution of servicing and collection matters, including arbitration with delinquent borrowers.</p>
          <h2><strong>3.5              </strong>Periodic Review</h2>
          <p>The Company shall identify and appoint appropriately skilled and knowledgeable persons to be responsible for conducting periodic review of the policy’s effectiveness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h1><strong>4.                  </strong>Servicing</h1>
          <h2><strong>4.1              </strong>Overview</h2>
          <p>To ensure compliance in areas of risk involved in loan servicing and collections, this Policy incorporates internal controls, ongoing monitoring, organizational accountability, timely corrective action, and training related to applicable servicing and collections laws.</p>
          <h2><strong>4.2              </strong>Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  (FDCPA)</h2>
          <p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) restricts and regulates the conduct of debt collectors, which generally includes debt collection agencies, creditors using false names or collecting for other unaffiliated creditors, collection attorneys, purchasers of delinquent debts, repossession companies, and suppliers or designers of deceptive forms.  It does not include creditors collecting their own debt in their own names. Additionally, the FDCPA only applies to the collection of consumer debt that was incurred primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.  Generally, the FDCPA does not apply to commercial and business purpose debts. While the Company does not anticipate that the FDCPA will apply to its planned commercial loan and servicing activities, the Company strives to ensure that its policies and procedures adhere to the spirit of the FDCPA. The Company endeavors that neither it nor its employees or vendors will engage in collections acts or practices that are abusive, false, misleading, unfair, or constitute harassment as defined under applicable state and federal laws.</p>
          <h2><strong>4.3              </strong>State Debt Collection Laws</h2>
          <p>Some states have enacted debt collection laws, some of which may apply to entities collecting on their own debts in addition to debt collected on behalf of third parties. It is Company’s policy to comply with applicable state collections laws when it contacts delinquent or defaulted borrowers (or others to the extent required by applicable law) with respect to debts owed to Company or to third-parties.</p>
          <p>The FDCPA and similar state laws restrict the time, place, method, and other factors involved in a collector’s communications with a borrower. The Company maintains a system of record for applicable state law requirements, and is responsible for ensuring that such requirements are followed when employees communicate with a delinquent or defaulted borrower.  Those requirements are also incorporated into the Company’s procedures, playbooks and scripts.  Employees are trained and instructed to follow these materials to ensure compliance with applicable state servicing and collections law.</p>
          <h2><strong>4.4              </strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</h2>
          <p>As applicable, the Policy operates in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACT Act”), when reporting collection of accounts. </p>
          <p>Any reporting of disputed accounts is carefully investigated prior to reporting to the credit bureaus (also known as consumer reporting agencies).  The FCRA imposes specific requirements to users of consumer reports and furnishers of consumer reports.  The FACT Act imposes specific requirements about sharing information with affiliates.  Notice to consumers must be provided before reporting negative information to a consumer reporting agency, or within 30 days after reporting such information. As of the effective date of this Policy, the Company does not intend to use or furnish consumer reports in connection with its servicing and collections activities, and as such, the FCRA and FACT Act should not apply to the Company’s servicing and collections activities. </p>
          <h2><strong>4.5              </strong>Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act (SCRA)</h2>
          <p>As applicable, the Policy operates in accordance with the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act (the “SCRA”), which provides certain protections to military personnel during periods of active military service (as defined in the SCRA).  The following classes of borrowers are protected under the SCRA:</p>
          <p>●        Members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard who are on active duty status or who are absent from duty as a result of being wounded or being granted leave; and</p>
          <p>●        Members of the National Guard who have received a specific type of activation orders.</p>
          <p>Members of the armed services are afforded the utmost respect and care when contacted as part of loan servicing and collections. At all times, Company executives and staff act to ensure members of the military and their families receive all the benefits afforded under the law. </p>
          <h2><strong>4.6              </strong>Fair Lending</h2>
          <p>The Company endeavors to comply with all applicable state and federal laws ensuring fair lending and equal access to credit, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), its implementing Regulation B, and related federal and state laws. Any decisions or considerations made in the course of Company’s collections or servicing activity shall be made without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital or familial status, age (provided the applicant has legal capacity to enter into a binding contract), handicap, receipt of public assistance, or any other basis protected by applicable law.</p>
          <h2><strong>4.7              </strong>Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Practices</h2>
          <p>As with all other activities conducted by the Company, Senior Management is responsible for ensuring that any servicing and collection activity is conducted fairly.  Management has implemented procedures to ensure that none of Company’s servicing and collections activities are construed as unfair, deceptive, or abusive.</p>
          <h1><strong>5.                  </strong>Servicing Requirements and Objectives</h1>
          <p>In addition to ensuring compliance with the applicable laws outlined above, the Company and its personnel strive to:</p>
          <p>●        Provide accurate and timely disclosures to a borrower as required by applicable law;</p>
          <p>●        Investigate, respond to, and make appropriate corrections in response to complaints asserted by a borrower;</p>
          <p>●        Provide a borrower with accurate and timely information and documents in response to the borrower’s requests for information about the borrower’s loan or account;</p>
          <p>●        Provide owners or assignees of loans or accounts with accurate and current information and documents about all loans or accounts they own;</p>
          <p>●        Provide appropriate personnel with access to accurate and current documents and information reflecting servicing and collection actions performed by third party vendors on behalf of the Company; and</p>
          <p>●        Facilitate periodic reviews of vendors engaged in servicing and collection activity on behalf of the Company, including by providing appropriate personnel with documents and information necessary to audit compliance by third party vendors with the Company’s contractual obligations and applicable law.</p>
          <h1><strong>6.                  </strong>Governance</h1>
          <p>The Company has adopted and follows written procedures to implement this Policy that meet the standards set forth in this Policy.  Procedures and changes to those procedures are reviewed and approved in advance of implementation by the Compliance Officer or their designee.  In addition, any significant procedural changes are communicated to relevant staff by the Compliance Officer or Senior Management through an email or training.</p>
          <p>No part of this Policy or its supporting procedures should be interpreted as contravening or superseding any other legal and regulatory requirements imposed upon the Company.  Any conflicts between this Policy and other legal obligations should be submitted immediately to the Compliance Officer for further evaluation.</p>
          <p>For any questions on this Policy or the Program, or to address any situations not covered herein, defer to the Compliance Officer prior to taking any action that may be non-compliant.</p>

          <h1>1.     Overview</h1>
          <p>KAPED INC. (“KAPED” or “Company”),  endeavors to fully comply with federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices (“UDAAP”), such as Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), as well as similar state laws (collectively, the “UDAAP Laws”). Company is not a bank, a bank holding company, or a subsidiary of a bank or a bank holding company. However, the Company partners with banks (each, a “Bank Partner”) to provide services to its customers that are within the scope of Bank Partners ’obligations regarding UDAAP. Accordingly, the Company takes its role in ensuring its practices comply with all UDAAP Laws very seriously.</p>
          <p>The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted this UDAAP Policy (“Policy”) as part of its compliance management system. The Compliance Officer serves as the individual responsible for all activities related to advertising and marketing in connection with the Company’s activities and oversees the development and implementation of this Policy.    </p>
          <h1>2.        Scope</h1>
          <p>This Policy applies to all activities and practices related to the Bank Partner’s offering and the Company’s activities in connection with financial services, including, but not limited to, marketing, customer service and collections (“Covered Practices”).</p>
          <p>This Policy applies to (i) Company employees; (ii) the Company’s executives and senior managers (collectively, “Senior Management”); and (iii) any vendors providing services to the Company.  </p>
          <h1>3.        Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
          <h2>3.1    Board of Directors</h2>
          <p>The Board oversees and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Company adheres to all applicable laws and company policies. The Board (or a designated Committee of the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving this Policy and any changes to the Policy as they occur.  The Board designates their ability to make changes in between its review of this Policy to the Compliance Officer.  The Board also maintains oversight of compliance with Policy and any significant risks that Senior Management identifies.</p>
          <h2>3.2    Compliance Officer</h2>
          <p>The Compliance Officer is responsible for evaluating and updating the Policy to reflect any changes to (i) Covered Practices, (ii) Company employees whose duties involve Covered Practices, or (iii) applicable marketing and advertising laws.  The Compliance Officer reviews the Policy on a periodic basis and when any such changes are made.  The Compliance Officer’s review includes consideration of feedback on the effectiveness of the Policy and any input from relevant Bank Partners.</p>
          <h2>3.3    Marketing</h2>
          <p>Employees who help market the program with a Bank Partner shall be trained and responsible for ensuring that marketing materials do not contravene applicable marketing and advertising laws. These employees will consult with the Compliance Officer, the legal team, and relevant Bank Partners prior to conducting any qualifying marketing campaigns.</p>
          <h2>3.4    Customer Acquisition </h2>
          <p>Employees who work on customer acquisition, including the design of product onboarding funnels and the operation of onboarding customers, are expected to comply with all applicable UDAAP Laws.

          <h2>3.5    Collections</h2>
          <p>From time to time, customers may owe the Company for items such as unpaid fees or bounced ACH account-funding activities.  The Company manages its collections activities internally and such activities may include processing and posting payments, sending notices to customers, and imposing penalty fees. The Company ensures that all UDAAP Laws are adhered to in the collections process.</p>
          <h2>3.6    Legal </h2>
          <p>The Company’s legal team advises on the applicable UDAAP laws, which are described at the end of this Policy. Where appropriate, the Company also engages outside counsel to advise on other marketing and advertising matters.</p>
          <h2>3.7    Periodic Review</h2>
          <p>The Company shall identify and appoint appropriately skilled and knowledgeable persons to be responsible for conducting periodic review of the policy’s effectiveness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h1>4.        UDAAP</h1>
          <p>Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibit UDAAP, are enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to entities within that regulator’s jurisdiction. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has broad authority to enforce similar provisions of the FTC Act against non-bank entities. And state regulators have some authority to also enforce federal laws, in addition to any state standard prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices.</p>
          <h2>4.1    Unfairness</h2>
          <p>An act or practice is considered “unfair” when:</p>
          <p>●        It causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. </p>
          <p>o    In most cases, a “substantial” injury involves monetary harm.</p>
          <p>o    In contrast, emotional impact and other more subjective types of harm will not ordinarily make a practice unfair.</p>
          <p>●        The customer injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers.</p>
          <p>●        The customer injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. </p>
          <p>In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, a regulator may also consider whether the act or practice violates an established public policy, or whether the act or practice results in unethical or unscrupulous conduct.  </p>
          <h2>4.2    Deception</h2>
          <p>An act or practice is considered  “deceptive” if each of the following elements are met:</p>
          <p>●        The act is a representation, omission, or practice that misleads or  is likely to mislead consumers. </p>
          <p>o    Examples include false oral or written representations, misleading price claims, sales of systematically defective products or services without adequate disclosures, use of bait and switch techniques, and failure to perform promised services.</p>
          <p>●        The consumer’s interpretation of the representation, omission, act, or practice is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>●        The representation, omission, or practice is material. </p>
          <p>o    A “material” act is one that influences the customer’s conduct or decision to use a product or service.</p>
          <p>o    In many cases, materiality can be presumed from the nature of the act or practice.</p>
          <p>Thus, a regulator may consider an act or practice to be deceptive if there is a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead a customer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the customer&#x27;s detriment.  </p>
          <h2>4.3    Abusiveness</h2>
          <p>An act or practice is considered  “abusive” if each of the following elements are met:</p>
          <p>●        The act or practice materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or takes unreasonable advantage of:</p>
          <p>o    A lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or services; .</p>
          <p>o    The inability of the consumer to protect his/her interests in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service; or</p>
          <p>o    The reasonable reliance by the consumer on a covered person to act in the interest of the consumer.</p>
          <p>Examples of allegedly “abusive” practices have involved products targeted at consumers that a regulator believed were vulnerable and unable to understand the products at issue, and a belief by consumers that they could rely on the regulated entity to protect their interests.</p>
          <h1>5.        UDAAP Compliance</h1>
          <p>The Company takes its responsibility to mitigate any potential risks posed by UDAAP very seriously.  The Company recognizes that UDAAP violations can cause significant financial injury to consumers, cause significant reputational risk to the Company and its Bank Partners, erode consumer confidence, and undermine the financial marketplace. </p>
          <h2>5.1    Marketing</h2>
          <p>When developing marketing materials, the Company’s product and business teams ensure that the Company fairly and adequately describes the terms and the material limitations of the offered product or service, including any related or optional products or services, and such terms are not misrepresented either affirmatively or by omission. In addition, the Company (a) ensures that these materials do not use fine print, separate statements or inconspicuous disclosures to correct potentially misleading statements, and (b) ensures that there is a reasonable factual basis for all representations made. [[Complete marketing policies are set forth in the Company’s Marketing and Advertising Policy.]]</p>
          <h2>5.2    Customer Acquisition</h2>
          <p>The Company ensures that no unfair or deceptive misrepresentations concerning a consumer’s eligibility for a particular product are made during the account solicitation and opening process. Specifically, the Company:</p>
          <p>●        Monitors complaints for potential misrepresentations in the customer acquisition process, as described in Section 6 (Complaints) below.</p>
          <p>●        Ensures that account opening requirements, including documentation, are uniformly applied across all customers.</p>
          <p>●        Trains its employees about who is authorized to approve accounts that need manual review and communicate decisions to prospective customers, as described in Section 7 (UDAAP Training) below.</p>
          <h2>5.3    Customer Service</h2>
          <p>The Company ensures that no unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices occur during the course of its conversations with customers and during the account servicing process. Specifically, Company and any vendors employed in collections and servicing:</p>
          <p>●        Ensure accurate and timely disclosures to customers, as required by applicable law.</p>
          <p>●        Provide customers with accurate and timely information and documents in response to requests for information about the customer’s account.</p>
          <p>●        Ensure accurate and timely processing of account funding payments.</p>
          <h2>5.4    Collections</h2>
          <p>The Company manages its collections activities internally and ensures that no unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices occur during the course of any collections activities.  Specifically, the Company does not tolerate the following:</p>
          <p>●        Collecting additional amounts in connection with amounts owed (including interest, fees, or charges) not expressly authorized by (i) agreement creating the amount owed and/or (ii) applicable law.</p>
          <p>●        Failing to post payments timely, or failing to properly credit a customer’s account, and then charging late fees.</p>
          <p>●        Taking possession of property without the legal right to do so.</p>
          <p>●        Falsely representing the character, amount, or legal status of amounts owed to the Company.</p>
          <p>●        Misrepresenting that a communication is from a government source or that the source of the communication is affiliated with the government.</p>
          <p>●        Misrepresenting whether information about a payment or nonpayment would be furnished to a credit reporting agency.</p>
          <p>●        Threatening any action that is not intended or authorized, including false threats of lawsuits, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for non-payment of amounts owed due to use of the product.</p>
          <h1>6.        Complaints</h1>
          <p>Complaints raising UDAAP concerns received through the Company are routed through customer service channels to the customer support team for resolution. Any complaints raising compliance issues with respect to UDAAP Laws will be raised with the Compliance Officer. Certain complaints may also be routed through the Bank Partner or may need to be escalated to the Bank Partner. The Company ensures that consumer-facing employees and vendors have appropriate complaint resolution processes in place.</p>
          <p>[[The Company’s Complaint management policies are set forth in the Company’s Complaint Management Polic<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4lgjQ7OJXhWDv9nle9gLQwYZ38_8OLLLmvzZ_vXm3g/edit">y</a>.]]</p>
          <h1>7.        UDAAP Training</h1>
          <p>The Company’s employees whose duties involve Covered Practices receive UDAAP training at least annually. In addition to annual training, such individuals receive appropriate retraining upon any changes to any applicable UDAAP Laws and regulations described below (Laws, Rules, Regulations and Other Sources). New employees of the Company whose duties involve Covered Activities receive UDAAP training during onboarding. The Company ensures that vendors whose services involve Covered Activities have received appropriate UDAAP training.</p>
          <h1>8.        Monitoring</h1>
          <p>The Compliance Officer promptly reports any self-identified UDAAP violations to Senior Management. Each quarter, the Compliance Officer gives the Company’s Senior Management a status report on the overall status of UDAAP-related initiatives, regulatory developments and emerging issues, and critical areas of risk.</p>
          <h1>9.        Recordkeeping</h1>
          <p>The Company maintains records of documents used in the ordinary course of its communications with customers. Marketing materials are retained by the Marketing Department. </p>
          <h1>10.      Laws, Rules, Regulations and Other Sources</h1>
          <p>This section provides a list of those laws, rules, regulations, guidelines, and other sources of legal guidance that the Company has determined are most relevant to its products, services, and activities.  This list is not exhaustive and is subject to periodic review and change, as appropriate.</p>
          <p>●        Section 1036 of the Dodd-Frank Act, codified at 12 U.S.C. § 5536.</p>
          <p>●        FTC Act, Section 5, codified at 15 USC § 45.</p>
          <p>●        State Laws: Any UDAAP violation may also violate state laws (for example, if a fee is charged in violation of a state law).  Given the relationship between UDAAP and other laws, the Company ensures that this Policy is reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s other policies in connection with each applicable consumer financial services product and/or program, which may provide context and assist with compliance with this Policy.</p>
